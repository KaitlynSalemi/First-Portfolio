## The Purpose 

The purpose of the exercise is to code with only a visual to guide you. We need to learn and practice the basics before we can move on to the more complicated programs. 


## The Process

After all of the files were created I started on the html. For each page I started at the top with the heading and ended with the footer. Inbetween I added the information and images needed for the page. Then, I styled the pages with CSS to make them look like the examples.

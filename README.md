# Portfolio

I inserted all the data into the html file.

made nav bar with a header "Kaitlyn Salemi" and three clickables that will take you to the other html pages

made a section with another header "About Me", horizontal line, image, and paragraph.

also made a footer. Is not visable in the picture below

copy and pasted the code from the first html file

kept the information in the nav and the footer

I replaced the paragraph with the images and the boxes

I moved the click-throughs to the nav bar, but I am still working on moving them to the right location

I reformated the portfolio page so that everything is floating correctly 

I changed the input of the message box so that the user can write multiple lines

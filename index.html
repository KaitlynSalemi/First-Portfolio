            My Name is Kaitlyn and I'm a Coding Student and Stage Manager from the Chicago Land Area. After graduation I would like to create applications for Stage Managers and other theater professionals.

            I find it hard to share things about myself, but i'll just keep writing. I curently live in Evanston and like walking by the beach. I have two roomates and one is a dog. I occasioanlly play the ukelele, but I havn't built any callisus on my fingures so it can be painful. I also occasionally embroider, but I havn't done that in several months. I am not great at keeping up with my hobbies, but I do like binging long TV sereies. I just finished the Spranos and my favorite show is Gilmore Girls.
